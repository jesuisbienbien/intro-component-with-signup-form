## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - Any `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say _"[Field Name] cannot be empty"_
  - The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say _"Looks like this is not an email"_

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it.

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

### What I learned

**autocomplete**
_prevent browsers from autocomplete inputs on reload_

```html
<input
  id="fname"
  class="form__input"
  type="text"
  name="fname"
  value=""
  placeholder="First Name"
  autocomplete="off"
/>
```

**flex:1**
_to split a parent element into equal parts, put flex:1 on all its child elements_

```css
.wrapper {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: row;
  gap: 5rem;
  max-width: 988px;
  margin: 5rem;
}
.wrapper > * {
  flex: 1;
}
```

**input background-image**

```css
.error-input {
  border: solid 1.5px var(--red);
  background-image: url(images/icon-error.svg);
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
  background-size: 25px 25px;
  background-position: right 10px bottom 10px;
}
```

### Continued development

Use this section to outline areas that you want to continue focusing on in future projects. These could be concepts you're still not completely comfortable with or techniques you found useful that you want to refine and perfect.

**Note: Delete this note and the content within this section and replace with your own plans for continued development.**

### Useful resources

- [Codepen](https://codepen.io/imohkay/pen/AWyojz) - I learned how to equally split the flex parent into 2 equal parts (can be done on more than 2 columns, not tested yet).
